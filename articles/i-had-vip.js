        @VIP. On Twitter. Yeah, I had it.
        But, for now, let's rewind.
        Over the summer, I had become increasingly interested in the world of usernames, and domains.
        I wanted to know everything.
        What constitutes a "good" username?
        How does one come up with a good username?
        Are there tradeoffs?
        Does a username have to contain your real name?
        Do the same principals apply to domains?
        I looked and looked at examples, good and bad.
        I scoured the internet for the best domains and domain hacks.
        Looking through the vast auctio{n sites, I took note of what was considered "valuable" and what wasn't.
        The username market was also a never-ending well of surprises.
        I slowly began to grasp what people consider a "valuable" username, and what such a name could be priced at.
        If you didn't know, a short, word username which is desirable is usually referred to as an "OG," which you can purchase in a variety of markets.
        Some of these "OG's" go for thousands of dollars.
        Yeah, thousands.
        My principles for a good and memorable username and/or domain are as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>
            The name should be short.
          </li>
          <li>
            The name should <em>not</em> have special characters or numbers.
          </li>
          <li>
            The name should be easily pronouncable. If you have to spell it out, it's a bad username.
          </li>
          <li>
            The name should be consistently reproducable. If you are going to have to change this username because it's taken on most other services, then it's not a good username (OG's are an exception).
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        I started to get to know a lot of the guys in the scene: the gods of OG's, the dealers, the buyers.
        Most were hackers but everyone had their motivations.
        The usernames were cracked, stolen, extorted, scammed, anything you could think of, but the market was booming.
        Kik, Twitter, Xbox Live, Instagram, they all had their own markets for usernames if you knew where to look.
        There was a lot to purchasing one of these however.
        They were just social media accounts of course, so one had to be sure they could "secure" the account as much as possible.
        That meant obtaining access to emails associated with the account, recovery questions, and original information about the account.
        Even then, the transaction would still be a shaky one.
        Scamming was rampant due to the ease of which some experts could "steal" a username back after it was sold.
        "Turboing" was a problem as well.
        Turboing, as they called it, was when someone uses a super-fast bot to try and steal a username when the username is released from it's original account.
        This usually means that when someone tries to switch a high priority username to another account, it can easily be stolen by a turboer and re-sold again.
        This can be prevented sometimes because the OG market is very tightly-knit, which means that usually, someone will alert other users that certain usernames were scammed or turboed.

        Anyway, one of the members who I had gotten to know was about to provide me the opportunity of a lifetime.
        Right before my eyes one of the greatest Twitter usernames of all time hit the market.
        I got word of it early, it was the username "@VIP."
